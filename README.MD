# Writing Unit Tests with ChatGPT Demo
### Task
`AccountAnalytics` provides an API with a couple statistic methods for a list of accounts. Your task is to implement unit tests in `AccountAnalyticsTest.java` using ChatGPT and prompt.

Use the GPT prompt skeleton:

```
Generate unit tests for the following code: {your_code}.
Use {your_library} for mocking and {your_library} for assertion.
For naming methods use {your_test_naming_pattern} naming convention as a pattern for unit tests.
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
* successfully passed unit tests
* meaningful unit tests


### Pre-conditions
* Java 8 knowledge
